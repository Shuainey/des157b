    &emsp; &emsp;My topic is broad. I basically want to split the seal into multiple sections representing the different aspects of Davis.
    Each section will consist of a "mini-game" relating to the topic at hand. For example, the map part of the seal will have 
    a "Geo-guesser" type mini-game to it where the user is provided a picture of a known place in UC Davis and is prompted to 
    put a pin on where the user think the place is located at. This is merely one of many mini-games that my partner, Brian Ton,
    and I are planning to implement. As for the target audience, I think it is very broad as the age-friendly games will attract
    children while the informative and engaging interface will catch the audults attentions as well. Although I feel like this project
    is on the ambitious side, I do believe that since I do have a partner who is passionate and willing to put in the hours, like myself,
    it will defintatly be possible.
