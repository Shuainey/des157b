      Written by Sasha Costanza-Chock, an Associate Professor of Civic Media at MIT, this book is 
      an exploration of how design might be led by marginalized communities, dismantle structural 
      inequality, and advance collective liberation and ecological survival. It tackles the elephant 
      in the room in that it addresses the various approaches and perspectives to the deisng process
      and depicts all of their advantages and pitfalls while also exposing the foul and harsh reality 
      of the design realm, especially in the large corporations.

      Designed by Susan Shelton, the Davis Centennial Seal is a representation of the histories behind 
      the emergence of Davis and what it symbolizes. Crafted with expertice and polished with creativity,
      this Seal depicts the aspects of Davis city that may spark interest to the visitors who have not yet 
      visted Davis before. From the origin of Davis, symbolic animals and crops, as well as the depiction
      of Univercity of California, Davis campus, the Seal can serve as a symbol for the city.

    <p>Vieira, Jon. “The Complete Guide to Cross-Cultural Design: Toptal®.” <i>Toptal Design Blog</i>, 14 Nov. 2019, www.toptal.com/designers/ux/guide-to-cross-cultural-design. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
      Cross-cultural design presents complex challenges, both linguistic and cultural. Despite 
      this, most designers wrongly assume that designing products for different cultures simply 
      requires language translation, switching currencies, and updating a few images to represent 
      the local culture. Designers have to contend with different languages, dialects, and dimensions 
      of national culture, as well as cultural differences in color psychology and mental models. 
      Furthermore, reading direction from culture to culture adds another layer of complexity as text 
      can be written left-to-right (LTR), right-to-left (RTL), and top-to-bottom. Cross-cultural 
      designers must also consider everything from text to images, to navigation patterns and CTAs 
      (calls-to-action) when designing for both LTR and RTL languages. Designers must use culturally 
      appropriate imagery in products reaching across cultures as an image that may be perfectly 
      acceptable in Western cultures may be considered inappropriate in some Middle Eastern countries. 
      Finally, designers must also account for text expansion in different languages, which can cause 
      text expansion of around 300%!
